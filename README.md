📚 Data Structures & Algorithms in Python

This repository contains my implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Python. I’ve been learning and practicing DSA concepts to strengthen my problem-solving and programming skills.



⚙️ Tech Stack

Language: Python 3

Editor/IDE: VS Code



📌 Notes

Each file is self-contained and demonstrates a single algorithm/problem.

Some problems include multiple approaches (brute force → optimized).

This repo is continuously updated as I practice more problems.




✨ Future Plans

Add Jupyter notebooks with explanations.

Document time and space complexity for each algorithm.

Include problem links (LeetCode, GFG, etc.).
